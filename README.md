Manually installed Linux (MiX) is a minimalist
[GNU](http://www.gnu.org/)/[Linux](https://www.kernel.org/) distribution.
Packages are compatible with [CRUX](https://crux.nu/) ports and
binaries.  System building and installation procedure follows the
[LFS](http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/) book.  Package management script
`pkz` resembles [Slackware](http://www.slackware.com/) `pkgtools`.
Resulting system can be tested in `chroot` environment or booted up
from the hard drive using BSD-like init scripts.  The work is licensed via
[GNU GPL](http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html).  All external sources
preserve their original licenses.
