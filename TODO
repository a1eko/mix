- to do, + done, o attention/pending, x ignore

o ports: disable stripping if unneeded or fragile (file .nostrip)
o crux (ports): .signature replaces .md5sum (see core/signify)
o ports (libreoffice*): presentation and spreadsheets depend on avahi at runtime
o ports (python3): rebuild with deps in coreopt and graphics
o ports (filesystem): never upgrade, overwrites /etc/{passwd,groups,shadow}
o ports: beware lfs linking /{bin,lib*,sbin} to /usr is not compatible with crux <= 3.6.1
o ports (gcc-fortran): avoided, fortran is enabled in gcc port
o ports (crux compat): replace 'pkginfo -i' and 'prt-get isinst' with 'pkz -i list'
o ports (crux compat): define unpack_source() in pkz, redefine in Pkgfile's
- ports (linux): beware broken usb3/xhci in v5.10.67+
- ports (zathura-ps): error loading PS file with ref to libspectre/ghostscript
- ports (dcron): consider removing from toolchain as in lfs (but e2fsprogs expects etc/cron.d; add to install.sh after filesystem)
o toolchain (python3): beware lfs switching to v3.10
o ports (babl): build error, disable babl-benchmark
+ toolchain (libstdc++, gcc pass2): Build libstdc++ in GCC pass 2, and remove the seperate libstdc++ pass 2 
o tools, ports (perl): watch crux upgrade to v5.34.1
o ports (graphviz): PKGMK_GRAPHVIZ=" --disable-man-pdfs" pkz build graphviz
- mix: prep to new release (see Release Notes for CRUX 3.7)
- gcc: update to v12.x
- ports (pkz): try using curl instead of wget (reliability issues)
- toolchain, ports (glibc, rc, ...): set LC_ALL=C.UTF-8 as default (eg, post-install: 'localedef -i POSIX -f UTF-8 C.UTF-8')
o toolchain, ports (install.sh, rc, ...): consider to replace /var/run with a symlink to /run
o ports (iptables): consider moving iptables to opt, nftables can translate iptable rules with just a few edge cases (crux compat)
o ports (libpcre): move libpcre2 to core, try to build at least all core ports with it, libpcre is EOL (crux compat)
