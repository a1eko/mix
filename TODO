- to do, + done, o attention/pending, x ignore

o ports: disable stripping if uneeded or fragile (file .nostrip)
o crux (ports): .signature replaces .md5sum (see core/signify)
o ports (libreoffice*): presentation and spreadsheets depend on avahi at runtime
o ports (python3): rebuild with deps in coreopt and graphics
o ports (filesystem): never upgrade, overwrites /etc/{passwd,groups,shadow}
o ports: beware lfs linking /{bin,lib*,sbin} to /usr is not compatible with crux <= 3.6.1
o ports (gcc-fortran): avoided, fortran is enabled in gcc port
o ports (crux compat): replace 'pkginfo -i' with 'pkz -i list'
- ports (crux compat): emulate 'prt-get isinst package' (pkginfo -i|grep ^package), also for multiple packages
- ports (pkz): try to use gnu parallel for stripping
