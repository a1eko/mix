- to do, + done, o attention/pending, x ignore

o ports: disable stripping if unneeded or fragile (file .nostrip)
o ports (python3): rebuild with deps in coreopt and graphics
o ports (filesystem): never upgrade, overwrites /etc/{passwd,groups,shadow}
o ports: beware lfs linking of /{bin,lib*,sbin} to /usr is not compatible with crux
o ports (gcc-fortran): crux port avoided, fortran is enabled in gcc port
o ports (crux compat): replace 'pkginfo -i' and 'prt-get isinst' with 'pkz -i list'
o ports (crux compat): define unpack_source() in pkz, redefine in Pkgfile's if needed
+ ports (zathura-ps): error loading PS file with ref to libspectre/ghostscript
o toolchain (file): crux build depends on autoconf, moved to BASE2 after auto-tools
o ports, tools (pkg-config): replaced with pkgconf (crux compat)
o ports (cmake, ninja, meson): added to tools/base system, reinstalling crux ports afterwards
o ports (meson, python3-*): remove old version when upgrading (use 'pkz upgrade', not 'pkz -f install')
o ports (linux-headers, linux): long-term support kernel line
o ports (linux-stable): the latest stable release (note: necessarily conflicts with linux)
+ ports (rc): restore mode 1777 of /dev/shm in rc.local, if needed
o ports (rust): remove before upgrading (messes up crates)
o ports (pkz): if pkz-upgrade fails, the old package is marked not installed (copied to .bak)
o mix (install.sh): put public keys from https://crux.nu/keys/{core,contrib,opt,xorg}.pub to /etc/ports/
o mix (install.sh): mix ports contain crux .sigantures (pkz.sh uses .md5sum if it exists)
- tools, ports (install.sh,gcc,glibc,openssh,rust,tar): replace /usr/libexec with /usr/lib (crux compat, FHS compliant)
o mix (rc.conf): start dbus, runtime dependency/warnings of some X apps
o ports (firefox): crashes (local AMD specific); disable WebGL (about:config, webgl.disabled=true)
- ports (linux-stable): v6.0.19 is EOL, switch to v6.1.x
+ ports (libetonyek, boost): libetonyek build broken by phoenix multiple definitions in boost v1.81 (see gentoo)
o ports (mesa): build with fakeroot (sudo build fails: ninja evoked at last step does not have root access)
! mix (toolchain): watch development of gcc v13
o ports (exiv2): darktable and ansel don't build with v0.28.0 (keep v0.27.6 or see archlinux patch)
o ports (nss): firefox crashes with v3.90, keep v3.89.1 (wait for crux patch or see blfs)
- ports (lensfun): broken python module (lensfun-update-data cannot run)
- tools, ports (util-linux): upgrade to v2.39, consider --runstatedir=/run (see lfs)
- tools (pkgconf): see lfs switching from pkg-config
