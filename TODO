o ports: prefer pip over ports for python packages 
o ports (linux-firmware): disable stripping "sudo pkz -c /dev/null build linux-firmware"

o ports (crux): replace 'pkginfo -i' with 'pkz -i list'
o linux kernel: "syncconfig" replaces "silentoldconfig"
o crux (ports): .signature replaces .md5sum (see core/signify)
o libreoffice: presentation and spreadsheets depend on avahi at runtime

o gcc: build with fortran support to avoid gcc-fortran
o openssh: watch ftp debian pool for updates v8.5+
o mix (install, rc, ports): deprecate /var/run, link to /run (watch crux > 3.6)
- crux (ports, pkz.conf): use JOBS to control the number of processes in parallel builds (also MAKEFLAGS="-j $JOBS") 
- ports, tools (linux): consider upgrading to v5.11+ (v5.10 is LTS)
- ports: sync to lfs wrt /usr no longer on a separate partition (check crux compat)
- libreoffice-bin: re-do packaging (unsupported by crux)
