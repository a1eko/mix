# - to do, + done, o attention/pending, x ignore

o config (rc.conf): start dbus (runtime dependency/warnings of some X apps)
o dist (install.sh): put public keys from https://crux.nu/keys/{core,contrib,opt,xorg}.pub to /etc/ports/
o dist (install.sh, pkz): mix ports may contain crux .sigantures, pkz.sh will use .md5sum if it exists
o ports (filesystem): never upgrade, overwrites /etc/{passwd,groups,shadow}
o ports (firefox): disable WebGL (about:config, webgl.disabled=true) if needed (local AMD specific)
o ports (meson, python3-*): remove old version when upgrading (use 'pkz upgrade', not 'pkz -f install')
o ports (pkz): if pkz-upgrade fails, the old package is marked not installed (copied to .bak)
o ports (python3): rebuild with deps in coreopt and graphics
o ports (rc): restore mode 1777 of /dev/shm in rc.local if needed
o ports: beware lfs linking of /{bin,lib*,sbin} to /usr is not compatible with crux
o ports: define unpack_source() in pkz, redefine in Pkgfile's if needed (crux compat)
o ports: disable stripping if unneeded or fragile (file .nostrip)
o ports: replace 'pkginfo -i' and 'prt-get isinst' with 'pkz -i list' (crux compat)
o tools (file): crux build depends on autoconf, moved to BASE2 after auto-tools
o tools, ports (*udev): beware lfs switching from eudev to udev from systemd
o tools, ports (cmake, ninja, meson): added to tools/base system, reinstalling crux ports afterwards
o tools, ports (gcc-fortran): crux port avoided, enable fortran in base gcc by default
o tools, ports (install.sh,gcc,glibc,openssh,rust,tar): beware crux replacing /usr/libexec with /usr/lib (FHS compliant)
o tools, ports (perl): keep v5.36 (crux compat)
o tools, ports (python3): keep v3.10 (crux compat)
- ports (eudev): remove group 'sgx' (lfs compat) or add to passwd/group (crux-3.8 compat)
- ports (dhcpcd, glibc): nscd: symbol lookup error: nscd: undefined symbol: __nss_disable_nscd, version GLIBC_PRIVATE
o ports (rust): remove rust before upgrading, cleanup rust dirs manually
+ tools (binutils): upgrade to v2.42
+ tools (glibc): upgrade to v2.39
o dist (pkz.conf): gentoo distfiles mirror not available
- tools (lz4): added by lfs as zstd dep
+ tools (xz): revert to v5.4.6 (see lfs)
- ports (llvm): upgrade the bundle to v18.1.7
- ports (libreoffice): move to v24.x
