# - to do, + done, o attention/pending, ? uncertain, x ignore

o config (rc.conf): start dbus (runtime dependency/warnings of some X apps)
o dist (install.sh): put public keys from https://crux.nu/keys/{core,contrib,opt,xorg}.pub to /etc/ports/
o dist (install.sh, pkz): mix ports may contain crux .sigantures, pkz.sh will use .md5sum if it exists
o ports (filesystem): never upgrade, overwrites /etc/{passwd,groups,shadow}
x ports (rc): restore mode 1777 of /dev/shm in rc.local if needed
x ports (firefox): disable WebGL (about:config, webgl.disabled=true) if needed (local AMD specific)
o ports (dbus, firefox): rebuild dbus in net.mix for dbus-launch to work with firefox
o ports (meson, python3-*): remove old version when upgrading (use 'pkz upgrade', not 'pkz -f install')
o ports (pkz): if pkz-upgrade fails, the old package is marked not installed (copied to .bak)
o ports (python3): rebuild with deps in coreopt and graphics
o ports: beware lfs linking of /{bin,lib*,sbin} to /usr is not compatible with crux
o tools, ports (gcc, glibc, rust): keep /usr/libexec as in lfs instructions
o ports (tar, ...): let crux replace /usr/libexec with /usr/lib (FHS compliant)
o ports: define unpack_source() in pkz, redefine in Pkgfile's if needed (crux compat)
o ports: disable stripping if unneeded or fragile (file .nostripin pkgdir)
o ports: replace 'pkginfo -i' and 'prt-get isinst' with 'pkz -i list' (crux compat)
o tools, ports (*udev): use crux port, lfs switched to udev from systemd
o tools, ports (cmake, ninja, meson): added to tools/base system, reinstalling crux ports afterwards
o tools, ports (gcc-fortran): avoid crux port, enable fortran in base gcc package instead
+ ports (eudev): add 'sgx' to /etc/group (crux compat, lfs removes it)
o ports (webkitgtk): needs at least 2GB of RAM per CPU vcore, reduce number of threads ('cmake --build -j 4')
o ports (webkitgtk): breaks surf build if compiled with gtk4 (add '-D USE_GTK4=OFF')
+ dist (nettle, rdfind, linux-{firmware,pam}, shadow): move to BASE2, add which as a dep for rdfind
+ ports (python3-setuptools): add dependencies, use crux port, disable optimization
+ ports (util-linux): build after linux-pam and sqlite3
+ ports (shadow): add libbsd and libmd dep
+ ports (siril): build error in version>=1.4.0, ERROR: Got unknown keyword arguments "soversion", "version"; workaround: downgrade meson to v1.9
o ports (meson): watch meson devs address siril build error
o ports (glm): remove old glm before upgrading or delete /usr/lib/cmake/glm directory
