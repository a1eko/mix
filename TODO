- to do, + done, o attention/pending, x ignore

o ports: disable stripping if unneeded or fragile (file .nostrip)
o crux (ports): .signature replaces .md5sum (see core/signify)
o ports (libreoffice*): presentation and spreadsheets depend on avahi at runtime
o ports (python3): rebuild with deps in coreopt and graphics
o ports (filesystem): never upgrade, overwrites /etc/{passwd,groups,shadow}
o ports: beware lfs linking of /{bin,lib*,sbin} to /usr is not compatible with crux
o ports (gcc-fortran): avoided, fortran is enabled in gcc port
o ports (crux compat): replace 'pkginfo -i' and 'prt-get isinst' with 'pkz -i list'
o ports (crux compat): define unpack_source() in pkz, redefine in Pkgfile's if needed
- ports (zathura-ps): error loading PS file with ref to libspectre/ghostscript
+ toolchain (dcron): remove from toolchain (lfs), add /etc/cron.d to filesystem (install.sh)
o ports (babl): build error, disable babl-benchmark
o ports (graphviz): PKGMK_GRAPHVIZ=" --disable-man-pdfs" pkz build graphviz
o ports (pkz): concider using curl or wget2 instead of wget (reliability issues)
+ toolchain, ports (install.sh, rc, ...): replace /var/run with a symlink to /run
x ports (libpcre): EOL, being replaced with libpcre2 (not in crux yet)
o toolchain (file): build depends on autoconf, moved to BUILD2 after auto-tools
o coreopt (cmake, ninja): use local ports (circular dependency in crux)
o toolchain (pkg-config): retain for base system as in lfs (replacement pkgconf in crux depends on meson and ninja)
- ports (graphics.mix): build without atk and at-spi2-atk (use at-spi2-core instead)
- ports (mesa, x.mix): mesa depends on glslang:spirv-{headers,tools}
- locales (glibc, bashrc): default to C.UTF-8 in glibc postinstall localedef and LC_ALL=C.UTF-8; see also crux locale-gen (glibc); but lsblk listing broken
- mix release (install.sh, *.mix): sync to crux v3.7
- ports (cmake, ninja, meson): consider adding to tools/base system, use crux ports afterwards
- strip: warning "plugin needed to handle lto object"
- tools, ports (linux{,-headers}): upgrade to latest LTS v5.15.x
- ports (Pkgfile): simplify scripts, don't search for READMEs etc.
- bpytop (user): replace with btop (see archlinux)
