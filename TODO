- to do, + done, o attention/pending, x ignore

o ports: disable stripping if unneeded or fragile (file .nostrip)
o crux (ports): .signature replaces .md5sum (see core/signify)
o ports (libreoffice*): presentation and spreadsheets depend on avahi at runtime
o ports (python3): rebuild with deps in coreopt and graphics
o ports (filesystem): never upgrade, overwrites /etc/{passwd,groups,shadow}
o ports: beware lfs linking of /{bin,lib*,sbin} to /usr is not compatible with crux
o ports (gcc-fortran): avoided, fortran is enabled in gcc port
o ports (crux compat): replace 'pkginfo -i' and 'prt-get isinst' with 'pkz -i list'
o ports (crux compat): define unpack_source() in pkz, redefine in Pkgfile's if needed
o ports (zathura-ps): error loading PS file with ref to libspectre/ghostscript
o ports (pkz): concider using curl instead of wget (reliability issues)
o toolchain (file): crux build depends on autoconf, moved to BASE2 after auto-tools
+ mix release (install.sh, *.mix): sync to crux v3.7
+ ports, tools (pkg-config): replace with pkgconf (see crux)
+ ports (cmake, ninja, meson): consider adding to tools/base system, reinstall crux ports afterwards
