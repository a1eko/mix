# - to do, + done, o attention/pending, x ignore

o config (rc.conf): start dbus (runtime dependency/warnings of some X apps)
+ dist (install.sh): put public keys from https://crux.nu/keys/{core,contrib,opt,xorg}.pub to /etc/ports/
o dist (install.sh, pkz): mix ports may contain crux .sigantures, pkz.sh will use .md5sum if it exists
o ports (filesystem): never upgrade, overwrites /etc/{passwd,groups,shadow}
o ports (firefox): disable WebGL (about:config, webgl.disabled=true) if needed (local AMD specific)
o ports (meson, python3-*): remove old version when upgrading (use 'pkz upgrade', not 'pkz -f install')
o ports (pkz): if pkz-upgrade fails, the old package is marked not installed (copied to .bak)
o ports (python3): rebuild with deps in coreopt and graphics
o ports (rc): restore mode 1777 of /dev/shm in rc.local if needed
o ports: beware lfs linking of /{bin,lib*,sbin} to /usr is not compatible with crux
o tools, ports (gcc, glibc, rust): beware crux replacing /usr/libexec with /usr/lib (FHS compliant), keep lfs instructions
o ports (tar, ...): let crux replace /usr/libexec with /usr/lib (FHS compliant)
o ports: define unpack_source() in pkz, redefine in Pkgfile's if needed (crux compat)
o ports: disable stripping if unneeded or fragile (file .nostrip)
o ports: replace 'pkginfo -i' and 'prt-get isinst' with 'pkz -i list' (crux compat)
o tools, ports (*udev): beware lfs switching from eudev to udev from systemd
o tools, ports (cmake, ninja, meson): added to tools/base system, reinstalling crux ports afterwards
o tools, ports (gcc-fortran): avoid crux port, enable fortran in base gcc package instead
+ ports (eudev): add 'sgx' to /etc/group (crux compat, lfs removes it)
x ports (dhcpcd, glibc): nscd: symbol lookup error: nscd: undefined symbol: __nss_disable_nscd, version GLIBC_PRIVATE
o ports (rust): remove rust before upgrading, cleanup rust dirs manually if needed
- tools, ports (pkz): gentoo distfiles mirror not available, drop mirror support
+ tools (lz4): added by lfs as zstd dep
+ ports (webkitgtk): needs at least 2GB of RAM per CPU vcore, limit threads usage if necessary ('cmake --build -j 4') in mix pkg
+ ports (webkitgtk): breaks surf build if compiled with gtk4 (add '-D USE_GTK4=OFF')
+ tools (flit-core): added to lfs as meson/wheel dependency
+ ports (clang): delete version checking in crux port (prt-get)
+ dist (tools): upgrade to crux v3.8 tools and packages
o dist (ports): signify fails for crux packages if file renaming is applied (renames=)
+ dist (nettle, rdfind, linux-{firmware,pam}, shadow): move to BASE2, add which as a dep for rdfind
+ ports (ncurses): switch to lfs build instructions and version 6.5-20250531
+ ports (psmisc): switch to lfs build instructions
+ ports (python3-setuptools): add dependencies, use crux port, disable optimization
+ ports (util-linux): build after linux-pam and sqlite3
+ ports (shadow): add libbsd and libmd dep
+ ports (surf): enable file download, eg to {$HOME,}/tmp
+ ports (tk): missing pkg
+ ports (openjpeg): missing pkg, replaced with openjpeg2
+ ports (moc): broken build, add path to m4 scripts: 'autoreconf -fvi -I /usr/share/gettext/m4'
x ports (liba52): missing pkg
x ports (libxvid): missing pkg
x ports (opencore-amr): missing pkg
x ports (schroedinger): missing pkg
+ ports (mjpegtools): broken build, add -Wno-template-body to CXXFLAGS
+ ports (x265): broken build
+ ports (mplayer): broken build, switch to latest checkout
+ ports (ffmpeg): missing ffplay binary, add dep libsdl2 to video.mix to build it
x ports (mpv): add dependencies to video.mix
o ports (libpng): watch apng patch (dep for firefox) to be merged to mainline (github pull 706)
+ ports (gcc): rebuild after installing isl
- ports (genesis): broken build
- ports (hugin): broken build
+ ports (nest-simulator): build
+ ports (xournalpp): broken build
+ ports (openimageio): upgrade to v3.0
+ ports (blender): upgrade to v4.5
- ports (inkscape): change ${name}-${version}* to ${name}-${version}_* in mix pkg
