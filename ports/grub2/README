INSTALLATION

	Once the grub2 port is installed, the boot loader itself can be installed
	like so:

	# grub-install /dev/<device>

	For example, to install grub2 into the master boot record of the first
	SCSI or SATA drive:

	# grub-install /dev/sda

	To install to the second partition of the first SCSI or SATA drive
	instead of the MBR:

	# grub-install /dev/sda2

CONFIGURATION

	A configuration menu file is required for grub2 to do more than display
	a command line. It can be created automatically using the 'grub-mkconfig'
	command like so:

	# grub-mkconfig > /boot/grub/grub.cfg

	NOTE: For grub-mkconfig to work properly the following conditions should
	      be met:

	      1) The kernel is expected to be named one of these ways:
	         /boot/vmlinuz-*
	         /vmlinuz-*
	         /boot/kernel-*

	         If the kernel is located somewhere else grub-mkconfig will NOT
	         find it! For example, '/boot/vmlinuz-3.10.28' is good and
	         '/boot/linux-3.10.28' would not be found.

	      2) When dual-booting with Linux installations on other partitions
	         or drives, grub-mkconfig will not find them without the extra
	         program 'os-prober' installed.

	The configuration file can also be created manually. A sample grub.cfg
	is included in the port.
