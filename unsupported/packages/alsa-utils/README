README for alsa-utils

alsa-utils includes an init script in /etc/rc.d called "alsa". In order to
save and restore your soundcard mixer levels at shutdown and boot, add
"alsa" to the SERVICES array in /etc/rc.conf.

NOTE: If the "alsa" init script attempts to restore mixer levels that have
not been saved yet, it will produce an error that looks like:

"alsactl: load_state:1677: Cannot open /var/lib/alsa/asound.state for
reading: No such file or directory"

This just means that the mixer settings have not yet been saved and can be
fixed by running "alsactl store".
