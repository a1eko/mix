To connect to unprotected network with ssid=SSID, add following lines
to /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf:

network={
  ssid="SSID"
  key_mgmt=NONE
}

To connect to an access point that uses a pre-shared key (PSK), put a
PASSWORD in /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf:

wpa_passphrase SSID PASSWORD >> /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf

For other examples, see wpa_supplicant/README file in the package
source tree.
